# EDA Notebook: Data Analysis and Visualization

Explore and analyze your dataset with this comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook. Utilizing popular techniques such as normalization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), outlier detection, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), this notebook provides a step-by-step guide to uncover patterns and insights in your data.

## Key Features:
- Normalization of numeric columns using StandardScaler.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- Outlier detection based on z-scores.
- Visualization of clusters and marked outliers using 2D scatter plots.
- PCA without outliers for a refined analysis.
- t-SNE visualization for exploring non-linear relationships in the data.
